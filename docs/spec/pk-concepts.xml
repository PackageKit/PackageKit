  <title>Important Concepts</title>
  <para>
    The following sections explain key concepts used internally in PackageKit.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="introduction-ideas-packageid">
    <title>Package ID</title>
    <para>
      One important idea is the <literal>package_id</literal>.
      This is the <literal>name;version;arch;data</literal> in
      a single string and is meant to represent a single package.
      This is important when multiple versions of a package are installed and
      only the correct one is removed.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>package_id</literal> is parsed and checked carefully in
      the helper code.
      The package arch and data is optional, but 3 <literal>;</literal>'s must
      be present.
      For instance, <literal>gnome-keyring-manager;2.18.0;;</literal> is
      valid but <literal>gnome-keyring-manager;2.18.0</literal> is not.
      The data field can be used for the repository name or any other purpose.
      It is designed to make the life of a backend writer a little bit easier.
    </para>
    <para>
      The data field for an installed package must be
      <literal>installed</literal> as this is used to identify which packages
      are installable or installed in the client tools.
    </para>
    <para>
      The backend must ensure that the package_id only matches on one
      single package.
      A single package_id must be enough to uniquely identify a single object
      in any repository used on the system.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="introduction-ideas-filters">
    <title>Filters</title>
    <para>
      Search filtering on the name is done in the backend for efficiency reasons.
      This can be added into the compiled backend if this is not possible
      in any new backend design.
    </para>
    <para>
      Filter options are:

    <informaltable>

              Free software. The package contains only software and
              other content that is available under a free license.
              See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing for a list
              of licenses that are considered free. If a license
              cannot be determined from the package metadata, or the
              status of the license is not known, the package will
              be marked as 'non-free'.
            </entry>
          </row>
          <row>
            <entry><literal>visible</literal> or <literal>~visible</literal></entry>
            <entry>
              Repositories may want to specify if a package should be visible
              in an application chooser.
            </entry>
          </row>
          <row>
            <entry><literal>supported</literal> or <literal>~supported</literal></entry>
            <entry>
              If the package is supported or is a third party addon.
            </entry>
          </row>
          <row>
            <entry><literal>basename</literal> or <literal>~basename</literal></entry>
            <entry>
              The basename filter will only return results according to the
              package basename.
              This is useful if you are searching for pm-utils and you only
              want to show the main pm-utils package, not any of the
              <literal>-devel</literal> or <literal>-debuginfo</literal> or
              <literal>-common</literal> suffixes in the UI.
              The basename is normally the original name of the source package.

  <sect1 id="introduction-errors">
    <title>Error Enums</title>
    <para>
      If you have to handle an error, try to use <literal>internal-error</literal>
      as little as possible.
      Just ask on the mailing list, and we can add some more error enums to
      cover the type of error in an abstract way as possible.
    </para>
    <para>
      Every error should have an enumerated type
      (e.g. <literal>out-of-memory</literal>) and also an error description.
      The error description is not translated and not converted into the users
      locale.
      The error description should be descriptive, as it's for power users
      and people trying to debug the problem.
      For instance, "Out of memory" is not helpful as an error description
      that is reported in a bugzilla, but "Could not create database index" is.
      For the description use <literal>;</literal> to separate the lines if
      required.
    </para>
    <para>
      The following error enumerated types are available for use in all
      backends:

              Not supported by the backend.
              NOTE: You shouldn't be setting non-NULL in the compiled
              backend symbol table if you find yourself using this.

              There was an unspecified internal error.
              NOTE: Please try and be more specific.
              If you are using this then we should probably add a new type.

              backend.

  <sect1 id="introduction-cancellation">
    <title>Cancellation</title>
    <para>
      If you have a multipart transaction that can be aborted in one phase but
      not another then the AllowCancel signal can be sent.
      This allows for example the yum download to be cancelled, but not the
      install transaction.
      By cancelling a job all subtransactions are killed.
    </para>
    <para>
      By default actions cannot be cancelled unless enabled in the backend.
      Use <literal>AllowCancel(true)</literal> to enable cancellation
      and <literal>AllowCancel(false)</literal> to disable it.
      This can be done for any job type.
    </para>
    <para>
      For compiled backends that are threaded, the
      <literal>cancel()</literal> method can be used to terminate
      the thread.
    </para>
    <para>
      For spawned backends, there are two staggered signals send to allow
      locks to be released or for the backend to clean up after itself:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Send the process <literal>SIGQUIT</literal>.</para>

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If the process has not already quit, send the process
          <literal>SIGKILL</literal> to terminate it.

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="introduction-ideas-transactionid">
    <title>Transaction ID</title>
    <para>
      A <literal>transaction_id</literal> is a unique identifier that
      identifies the present or past transaction.
      A transaction is made up of one or more sub-transactions.
      A transaction has one <literal>role</literal> for the entire lifetime,
      but the transaction can different values of <literal>status</literal>
      as the transaction is processed.
    </para>
    <para>
      For example, if the user "Installed OpenOffice" and the backend has to:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          update libxml2 as a dependency
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          install java as dependency
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          install openoffice-bin
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          install openoffice-clipart
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      This is one single transaction with the role <literal>install</literal>,
      with 4 different sub-transactions.
      This allows the user to rollback transactions with selected backends,
      rather than select sub-transactions which may need complex conflict
      resolution.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>transaction_id</literal> must be of the format
      <literal>job;identifier;data</literal> where the daemon controls
      all parameters.
      <literal>job</literal> is a monotonically updating number and is
      retained over reboots.
      <literal>identifier</literal> is random data used by the daemon to
      ensure jobs started in parallel cannot race, and also to make a
      malicious client program harder to write.
      <literal>data</literal> can be used for ref-counting in the backend or
      for any other purpose.
      It is designed to make the life of a backend writer a little bit easier.
      An example <literal>transaction_id</literal> would be
      <literal>45;dafeca;checkpoint32</literal>
