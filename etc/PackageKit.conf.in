# Use strict developer checking in the daemon
#
# This should be set to TRUE if the backend should be run in strict compliance

# How long the transaction is valid before it's destroyed, in seconds
#
# The client only has a finite amount of time to use the object, else it is

# How long the transaction should be queriable after it is finished, in seconds
#
# Give the client a few seconds to still query the transaction after it has

# If certain operations should be done using IDLE bandwidth
#
# TCP Low Priority is a congestion control algorithm included in the kernel.
# Connections using this algorithm will use only idle bandwidth. In other words,
# it is a self-tuning TCP stack. Setting this to FALSE will mean that the check
# for updates happens more quickly, at the expense of other network applications
# such as firefox and other file downloaders.
#
# If the user is running the network at 100% for extended periods of time, then
# the update check may be starved and take a very long time to complete. In this
# rare case, this setting should be set to FALSE.
#
# By also setting this setting to TRUE makes the possibility of a environment
# mismatch much higher for a spawned backend. This will make switching from idle
# operations (such as GetUpdates) and full speed operations (such as
# InstallPackages) take longer. If this is a concern, then set this to FALSE.
#
# default=true
UseIdleBandwidth=true

# Processes that cannot be updated when they are running
#
# Some processes do not cope well when they are upgraded when the binary is
# running. These include things like firefox, where updating causes the original
# instance to misbehave as some components are not locked in memory.
#
# Applications can be added here that do not cope well with being updated.
#
# NOTE: you should not list applications here that the user has no permission
# or cannot shutdown without the session exploding. For instance, listing
# /sbin/dbus-daemon or /usr/sbin/haldaemon would be a really bad idea.
#
# Seporate entries can be seporated with the ';' character.
#
# default=/usr/lib/*/firefox
NoUpdateProcessList=/usr/lib/*/firefox

# If the backend should use threads to avoid blocking the daemon for other users
#
# The daemon, packagekitd, is shared by multiple users. Users are allowed to
# create and send transactions when other transactions are being processed.
# To do this, the backend action is created in a thread, but some libraries
# notably libdbus and dbus-glib, are less threadsafe then they probably should
# be.
#
# Only developers need to change this value, normally for debugging purposes.
#
# default=true
UseThreadsInBackend=true

# If a custom root should be used when installing packages
#
# A custom route can be used to install to a LTSP instance or a virtual machine
# image, typically using chroot or by mounting an image using virt-inspector.
#
# Additional authentication is required to change the root from the default.
#
# Most users do not need to change this value, as you need to have setup a
# native package database (e.g. the rpmdb) on the new root.
#
# default=/
UseRoot=/
