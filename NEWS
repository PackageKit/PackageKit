Version 1.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2014-09-12

Notes:
 - After over 7 years, 99 tarball releases and 11697 commits from 284 people
   we've finally released the first stable version. Woohoo!

 - I wanted to sent out a heart-felt thank you to all the people who have
   contributed to the success of this project. I couldn't have done it on my
   own and quite a few people were more important than they realize.

 - Now, onto more practical aspects. These are the big changes for this release:

  * The offline update functionality has moved to a proper D-Bus interface and
    the pkexec helpers have been removed. Offline updates is an important
    feature that no longer deserves to be bolted-on. All the existing users
    have been ported to the new interface, but you need 3.13.92 if you're
    running GNOME from unstable or jhbuild.

  * No more plugins. Both in-tree and out-of-tree plugins were the biggest
    source of crashes, and with the systemd offline updates merged into the core
    daemon they are just not reuired anymore. All affected projects have been
    notified.

  * No more conary, opkg, smart or yum plugins. These have been unmaintained and
    broken for over two years, so time to give them the heave-ho.

  * The alpm, aptcc, hif and zypp plugins have had lots of love, and are up to
    date with the latest features and working well.

Version 0.8.14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2013-12-02

Notes:
 - We've removed and deprecated the parts of PackageKit that either didn't
   work very well, or simply were not being used. The library and soname stays
   the same, but a lot of daemon cruft has been removed.
 - If you're wondering why a particular feature was removed, please either
   look at the commit history or have a look at the ChangeLog.
 - A lot of the work above focused on speed, and packagekitd is substantially
   faster on most backends now. 100ms here, 50ms there; things feel a lot more
   snappy doing the most common operations.

Version 0.8.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2012-08-06

Notes:
 - This is the first release that features the work done by Matthias to
   allow multiple transactions to run in parallel.
   This makes applications such as gnome-software and software-center
   run without having to wait for the global lock just to query.
 - The aptcc and zif backends are run in parallel by default, other
   backends still run each transaction one at a time.

Version 0.8.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2012-07-16

Notes:
 - We broke backend API and libpackagekit-glib and libpackagekit-qt
   ABI. Again. This should hopefully be the last soname bump in the
   0.8.x series.
 - We split up PkBackend into PkBackend and PkBackendJob. It's a pretty
   huge internal change, but it'll allow us to turn on the parallel
   transactions stuff in the next couple of releases. Most backends
   need updating, although sed has done a lot of the heavy lifting.
 - The systemd-updates has had a lot of bugfixes and poilish and is now
   ready to be used by end users. There's even a test document now.
 - You can now write plugins that get run if the daemon is told to drop
   internal state as another package manager is running, e.g. YUM CLI.

Version 0.8.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2012-06-25

Notes:
 - We've broken a lot of API in this release. A LOT. If you're using the
   systemd D-Bus interface of PackageKit, then it's likely you'll have
   to spend a few minutes converting to the new interfaces.
   If you use the packagekit-glib or packagekit-qt bindings they'll
   be the odd change too, but nothing quite as drastic.
 - Both the client libraries broke ABI, so there's a soname bump.
 - Needless to say, it's probably not a good idea to push all this new
   and broken code into your super-stable paid-for-support distro.
 - If anyone has questions about porting, grab one of us developers on
   the PackageKit mailing list.

Version 0.7.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2011-09-05

Notes:
 - This is the first release of the unstable 0.7.x series.
 - This code removes a lot of deprecated code and compatibility shims
   compared to the previous branch.
 - Highlights of this release is the new transaction plugin interface
   that allows external projects to add modules for interfacing with
   PackageKit. This allows projects such as Listaller to interface with
   PackageKit to install self contained software blobs.
   See http://listaller.tenstral.net/ for more information.
 - The daemon code is now using GDBus rather than dbus-glib, but the
   libpackagekit-glib library is still using the latter. It'll be
   converted hopefully in time for 0.7.1.
 - It's probably not a good idea to use releases from this branch for
   stable distros or enterprise products!

Version 0.5.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2009-10-05

Notes:
 - Quite a few method and property additions and clarifications to the spec,
   with 7 methods now deprecated. We'll be supporting the deprecated methods all
   through 0.5.x so client code does not have to worry until 0.6.x.
 - Support for using idle bandwidth, disk and CPU in some circumstances.
 - A new 'slapt' backend for slackware packages as a preview release.
 - This is the first release to use the glib2 library internally. This makes the
   client tools faster, more stable and more supportable. The headers are also
   now used in the daemon and many of the synchronous methods are now async.
   It is not yet recommended for external client programs use packagekit-glib2
   as the API is not yet set in stone and may change. This is expected in 0.6.x.

Specification
 - Add a Speed property to the interface as some users require the download speed (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a per-Transaction ::Changed() signal and deprecate the other FooChanged() signals (Richard Hughes)
 - Add OR delimiters to SearchName, SearchDetails, SearchGroup, SearchFile and WhatProvides (Richard Hughes)
 - Add ElapsedTime and RemainingTime as properties on the Transaction interface (Richard Hughes)
 - Mandate that ::Files() from DownloadPackages must be one per package, with the package_id set correctly (Richard Hughes)
 - Deprecate SetLocale() and add another method to replace it, SetHints() (Richard Hughes)

Version 0.5.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2009-08-03

Notes
 - We've done some initial security review on this release, and the PackageKit
   architecture in general. We've made a few small changes, but it all looked
   pretty good overall. Certainly nothing to worry about.
   See http://cgit.freedesktop.org/packagekit/plain/docs/security.txt

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2007-11-01

* Backends:
 - Add a new python based APT backend (Ali Sabil)
 - Significant smart backend updates (James Bowes)
 - Significant PiSi backend updates (S.Çağlar Onur)
 - More yum functionality (James Bowes, Tim Lauridsen)
 - More box functionality (Grzegorz Dabrowski)

* New features:
 - Allow PkClient to be set promiscuous, i.e. to report all activity and use to
   get the errors and completions (Richard Hughes)
 - Add pk-backend-python.[c|h], for common spawning functions for python
   backends and switch the backends to use them (James Bowes)
 - Use egg_strzero, egg_strlen and pk_strcmp to increase performance and
   potentally improve security (Richard Hughes)
 - Add resolve support to pkcon get depends/requires/description/updatedetail
   (S.Çağlar Onur)
 - Try to guess the remaining time of the transaction using a super nifty
   algorithm (Richard Hughes)
 - Add Cleanup and Obsoleting as info states so we don't scare the user with
   DELETING when they are doing an upgrade (Richard Hughes, Tim Lauridsen)

* API changes:
 - Switch the discrete GetPercentage and GetSubPercentage to a GetProgress
   method that allows us to report remaining and elapsed time into the
   client UI (Richard Hughes)

* Bugfixes:
 - Sanitise more text from the backends in case the backend sends invalid or
   malicious text (Richard Hughes)
 - Defer destroying the backend for 5 seconds so we can query it in the
   finished handler in clients (Richard Hughes)
 - Add GetFiles method so we don't slow down the GUI box getting the file list
   every time we click a package (James Bowes)
 - Calculate progress bar length based on terminal columns (James Bowes)
 - Convert RefreshCache to a privileged operation but with default to allow
   when on active console. The distro can then patch this default to whatever
   depending on the security policy - and the admin can of course change the
   default (S.Çağlar Onur)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2007-10-23

* New backends:
 - A SMART backend (James Bowes)
 - A PiSi backend (S.Çağlar Onur)

* New features:
 - A better, easier to use website; http://www.packagekit.org (Richard Hughes)
 - Added missing install-file.py so we can do local rpm installs (Tim Lauridsen)
 - Be ultra-paranoid about validating input from the user (Richard Hughes)
 - Send SIGQUIT and then SIGKILL after a little delay, so we can clean up the
   backends nicely by unlocking when we cancel (Richard Hughes)
 - Add resolve functionality in pkcon to allow non-package_id use, for instance
   'pkcon remove gimp' now does the right thing (Richard Hughes)
 - Display a pulsing progress bar for no-progress-updates and percentage-update
   that is shown when using a console (James Bowes)
 - Remove the hard dependency on NetworkManager so other networking stacks
   can be used instead (S.Çağlar Onur, Richard Hughes)
 - Add a filter parameter for Resolve() so we can do the filtering in the
   spawned backend without duplicating code (James Bowes, Richard Hughes)
 - Substantial additions to the box backend (Grzegorz Dabrowski)
 - Add GetRepoList and RepoEnable to the yum backend (Tim Lauridsen)
 - Add bash completion script for pkcon (James Bowes)
 - Get the repo list for the aplm backend (Andreas Obergrusberger)

* API changes:
 - Store the transaction database in /var/lib rather than /var/db (James Bowes)
 - Don't expose the private list in PkTaskList, instead use verified functions
   to ensure we can't corrupt data accidentally (Richard Hughes)
 - Don't export the private data array in PkClient or PkPackageList - this
   breaks API, so the library version has been bumped (Richard Hughes)

* Bugfixes:
 - Fix the resolve method parameter passing - now pk-install-package should work
   correctly (James Bowes)
 - Fix all the copyright notices to be a standard GPL2+ boilerplate license
   text (Tom Parker, Robin Norwood)
 - Dist the local apt headers so the apt backend can be compiled from a tarball
   rather than just from git (Richard Hughes)
 - Fix a 1-in-10 random daemon startup crash when backends do libnm_glib init,
   shutdown, init, shutdown repeatedly (Richard Hughes)
