== Indent ==

Use "indent -kr -i8 -pcs -lp -lps -psl *.c" to convert to "mostly correct"
indenting levels.

== Tabs ==

Tabs are the size of 8 spaces, and should be used in preference to spaces.

== Overlong lines ==

Functions that are too long for one line are indented with tabs and then
spaces to the start of the bracket:

libnotify_event ("HAL does not have PowerManagement capability",
		 LIBNOTIFY_URGENCY_CRITICAL, NULL);

== Braces ==

Functions have curly brace on same line:

if (icon == NULL) {
	g_warning ("Cannot find icon");
	return FALSE;
}

Braces not-ommitted for single line:

if (!false) {
	g_warning ("Cannot find icon");
}
