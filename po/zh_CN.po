#. SECURITY:
#. - Normal users require admin authentication to remove packages as
#. this can make the system unbootable or stop other applications from
#. working.
#. - Be sure to close the tool used to remove the packages after the
#. admin authentication has been obtained, otherwise packages can still
#. be removed. If this is not possible, change this authentication to
#. 'auth_admin'.

#. system to previously patched security vulnerabilities.

#. SECURITY:

#. updates.
